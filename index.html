        <h3>Linguistic Intelligence:</h3>
        <p>or “word smarts” is competence with spoken and written language. It is the ability to effectively use words to express ideas (as well as understand the ideas of others through their words) and to comprehend complex vocabularies using uncommon, technical, or foreign words. This type of intelligence is often found among writers, public speakers, language learners and teachers, and in other professions which involve juggling words and speech. Linguistic intelligence has also been associated with academic problem-solving and abstract reasoning skills. Those who are high in this type of intelligence often enjoy crossword puzzles, Scrabble, reading and writing, and all manner of wordplay.</p>
        <p><strong>Study Tips:</strong> Write summaries of what you learn to reinforce your understanding. Teach others to explain concepts clearly. Use tools like flashcards and journaling to expand your vocabulary.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="type2" class="content-box">
        <h3>Logical-Mathematical Intelligence:</h3>
        <p>“number smarts” or “reasoning smarts,” is the ability to work well with numbers, complex concepts, and scientific ideas. It involves calculating, quantifying, hypothesizing, and thinking in mathematical abstractions and sequential reasoning, as well as inductive and deductive thinking. People who are high in this type of intelligence are often interested in sequential patterns, logical connections, puzzles, strategy games, experiments, and games that involve numbers (such as Sudoku). This type of intelligence is often found among mathematicians, detectives, and scientists.</p>
        <p><strong>Study Tips:</strong> Break down complex problems into smaller parts. Use diagrams or charts to visualize concepts. Engage in problem-solving exercises or logical puzzles to deepen your understanding.</p>
    </div>
